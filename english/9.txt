while the film initially presents itself as a profound cinematic experience, it quickly unravels into a pretentious and incoherent narrative that relies too heavily on abstract symbolism rather than meaningful storytelling. The characters lack depth, the dialogue feels forced and unnatural, and the pacing is unbearably sluggish. Despite its visually ambitious approach, the film ultimately fails to connect with its audience on an emotional level. It appears more concerned with showcasing the directorâ€™s artistic ego than delivering a compelling or relatable message. By the end, what remains is a hollow, self-indulgent piece of cinema that confuses ambiguity with depth and leaves viewers feeling frustrated rather than enlightened.
