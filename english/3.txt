The movie was a massive letdown, and it failed to live up to any expectations. From the very beginning, it was clear that the plot was weak and predictable, with no real substance or originality. The characters were flat, and I couldn’t connect with any of them. The performances felt forced and lacked the emotional depth required to make the audience care about the story. The pacing of the movie was incredibly slow, with many scenes dragging on unnecessarily, making the entire experience feel like a chore to sit through. The special effects, which were supposed to enhance the film, only felt gimmicky and out of place. The direction was poorly executed, and the movie lacked any real focus, jumping from one scene to the next without any clear direction. The soundtrack didn’t help either, as it failed to add any emotional depth to the scenes, leaving the movie feeling flat and uninspiring. In the end, it was an experience I wish I could forget, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging, entertaining film
