	The political crisis deepened as more people began to question the true character of the nation's leadership. While the government projected an image of strength and stability, behind the scenes, corruption, dishonesty, and a lack of transparency dominated every decision. The leader’s character, once seen as decisive, is now viewed as authoritarian and self-serving. Citizens are losing faith in a system that favors power over people. Promises are made only to be broken, and dissent is silenced through manipulation. This isn’t governance—it's a reflection of a broken character at the highest levels, infecting the entire structure of democracy.
