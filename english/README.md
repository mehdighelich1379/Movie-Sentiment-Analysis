### Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews using Deep Learning (Sequence Model)

#### Project Overview:
In this project, we performed Sentiment Analysis on a collection of movie reviews using deep learning. The dataset consists of two folders, positive and negative, containing text files with reviews that are either positive or negative. The goal of this project was to classify the sentiment of these reviews using a Sequence Model built with Deep Learning techniques.

### Steps Taken in the Project:

1. Reading and Preparing the Dataset:
   - I began by reading the text files from the positive and negative folders. Each folder contained reviews that were labeled as positive or negative.
   - The reviews were pre-processed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - The following steps were performed for text preprocessing:
     - Tokenization: I split the text into individual tokens (words).
     - Translation: I translated non-English characters into English (if applicable).
     - Punctuation Removal: I removed any punctuation marks to focus only on the words.
     - Stopword Removal: I eliminated common stopwords like "and", "the", "is", etc., which do not add much value to the sentiment classification.

3. Data Splitting:
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets. I used X_train, X_test for the features (reviews), and y_train, y_test for the labels (positive or negative sentiment).

4. Tokenization and Sequence Preparation:
   - I used the Tokenizer to convert the text into sequences of integers. Each word in the text was assigned a unique integer.
   - I used Tokenizer.texts_to_sequences() to convert the reviews into sequences of integers that represent the words in each review.
   - To make the sequences uniform in length, I applied pad_sequences to ensure that all input sequences have the same length.

5. Building the Sequence Model:
   - I created a Sequence Model using a Deep Learning architecture suitable for text data. This model is designed to process sequences of words and classify them into categories (positive or negative sentiment).
   - The model consisted of several layers, such as:
     - Embedding Layer: This layer converts words into dense vectors of fixed size, representing the words in a continuous vector space.
     - LSTM Layer: I used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to process the sequence data and capture the dependencies between words in the text.
     - Dense Layer: A fully connected layer that outputs the classification result (positive or negative).
   
6. Model Compilation and Training:
   - The model was compiled with a loss function and optimizer suitable for classification tasks. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used for binary classification (positive or negative sentiment).
   - The model was trained using the training data (X_train, y_train) and evaluated on the test data (X_test, y_test).
   
7. Callbacks:
   - I defined callbacks to prevent overfitting. Specifically, I used an EarlyStopping callback to stop training if the model's performance on the validation set did not improve for a certain number of epochs. This helped prevent the model from training for too long and overfitting.
   
8. Model Evaluation:
   - After training the model, I evaluated its performance on the test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 85%, which was considered a good result for the sentiment analysis task.

9. Saving the Best Model:
   - The best model, which achieved the highest accuracy, was saved for future use. This model can be used to classify new movie reviews into positive or negative categories.

### Conclusion:

In this project, I successfully implemented a Sentiment Analysis system using Deep Learning and a Sequence Model. The model was trained on a collection of positive and negative movie reviews, and it achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. By using techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and padding sequences, I was able to build a robust model capable of classifying movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments. The model is now ready for deployment to classify new movie reviews.
